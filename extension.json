    "longDescription": "Keep track with what you still need to do! (probably a lot). ReplitNotes is a sequel to the Todo Extension from me. It has user-wide code snippets, a nicer UI, works better, and doesn't create files in your repl. The data gets stored outside of your repl. That's wayy better then before, doesn't take up any bytes for you, and your content is secure!!\n\nPlease don't store sensitive information since it's not 100% private. Your username and repl slug get hashed, and your snippets and notes get encrypted. So it's pretty safe, but still don't share secret keys!",
